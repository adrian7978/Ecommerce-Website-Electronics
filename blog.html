        <h3 align="center">The impact of technology on people's lives</h3>
        <p>
            Technology is transforming the globe. Technology's greatest benefit is that it brings people together.
            Technology has a lot of advantages, but it also has a lot of drawbacks. We can execute fairly complex jobs
            relatively easily with the help of technology. It is fair to claim that technology has made our lives
            considerably easier and more comfortable. Every day, the globe advances and develops. Because of
            technological advancements, the world has become a completely different place. There are numerous aspects of
            our daily life in which we rely on various technologies to do our responsibilities.The technological
            discoveries, inventions, and engineering applications utilized within society to complete specific jobs have
            benefitted and hampered ancient and modern human civilizations alike. Technological advancements have become
            required for societies to exist and evolve, whereas human societies' culture, ideas, and goals have affected
            how they have generated, benefitted from, and been hampered by technology. Human societies/civilizations and
            their technology have become interwoven due to the fact that technical systems are produced by humans and
            reflect the very essence of a population's needs and culture.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="lefttext">
                Technology has an impact on how people communicate, learn, and think. It contributes to society and
                influences how individuals interact on a daily basis. In today's world, technology plays a critical
                role. Ithas both beneficial and negative repercussions on the planet, as well as a direct impact on
                people'lives.We live in a time when technical advancements are commonplace. Cell phones and the internet
                are twexamples. However, there is a drawback to technical advancements.<br><br>Learning is one component
                of technologyhas had a significant impact on society. Learning hasbecommore interactive and
                collaborative, allowing people to better engage with the topics they are learnin an having difficulty
                with. It also improves access to resources. With the invention of the internet, we no have access to
                information at all hours of the day and night, and you can find practically anythin online It also makes
                it easy for pupils to complete their assignments. Students can take quizzes and exams morreadily, and
                teachers can hold more productive online classes. It also pushes the classroom'boundaries,encouraging
                self-paced learning. Learning can be accessed via YouTube and social media.This is more beneficial to
                students' learning than sitting in lectures and reading textbooks. Learning has become more enjoyable
                and convenient as a result of technology improvements.<br /><br /> Another way that technology has
                influenced society is through communication, or how we talk and communicate with one other around the
                world. Many new forms of electronic communication have emerged as a result of technology. Emails, social
                networking, facetime with someone on the other side of the planet, and video conferencing are all
                examples. Finally, technical improvements in the health profession have contributed to individuals being
                safe and healthy. Many innovative phone apps allow consumers to keep track of their weight, calorie
                intake, heart rate, and other health characteristics at any time of day. Mobile communication, on the
                other hand, appears to have a detrimental impact on people's ability to be social and make face-to-face
                contact, according to studies. Communication and interpersonal relationships may suffer as a result of
                mobile technology. There is less personal time, and you may find that you don't have enough time for
                yourself because you are constantly in contact with others. It can also cause you
                to lose focus on your studies. There's also a loss of privacy because anyone, at any time, can find you
                wherever. Finally, all of these factors have an influence on how people behave today. Our way of life
                would be less complicated without technological improvements. Human behavior is now shaped by
                technological factors.</span>
